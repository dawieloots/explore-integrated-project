# Project objective

The objective of this project is to analyze insurance data in order to derive valuable insights that can positively impact the business operations.

# Data Analysis 

An analysis of the insurance data revealed that a significant portion of claims (approximately 25%) contain elements indicative of fraud. The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process, and additional features were integrated to enhance the analysis. A comprehensive PowerBI dashboard was developed to present meaningful insights into the potential drivers of fraudulent claims.

# Predictive Modelling

Furthermore, a predictive machine learning model was constructed to classify claims as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. This model was subsequently deployed as a web application, intended for use by relevant staff members. It is recommended that all claims assessment personnel be granted access to this application. By utilizing this tool, staff can proactively identify potential fraudulent claims at an early stage, ideally before any fraudulent claims are processed and paid.
